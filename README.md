Various practice snippets that I've written to keep my skills active

I've been working in various vendor-specific systems and code bases which has caused my programming skills to stagnate.  This repo is designed with the intention of keeping my coding practices up to date and share the work that I've done.
A few of these snippets were from ideas from Codewars, a site dedicated to code practicing and code reviews based on solutions presented by other coders.  It's helped me practice and given me ideas on how to improve my code and what to focus on next.
